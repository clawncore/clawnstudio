Build a small, modern website project for “Clawn Media Studio”, a creative digital gift and motion design service.

The website should be simple but visually clean, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES modules). The animation engine is anime.js (imported via CDN).

Requirements:

Pages (3 total):

index.html → Landing page showing the animated shapes (circle, triangle, square) moving using anime.js.

auth.html → A simple “memorable word” login page. No backend. If the user enters "clawn" (case-insensitive), redirect to timeline.html. Otherwise, show an error message.

timeline.html → Scrollable list of events or templates, with fade-in effects as the user scrolls.

Landing Page (index.html):

Include a heading: “Clawn Media Studio”.

A short tagline: “Creative motion. Minimal flow.”

Below that, display three shapes: a triangle, a square, and a circle — centered and evenly spaced.

Add a button labeled “Get Started” that links to the login page.

Animate the shapes using anime.js with the following rules:

.circle: moves 15rem left-right, loops infinitely.

.triangle: moves 15rem, rotates 1 turn, alternates, loops infinitely.

.square: moves 15rem, alternates, loops infinitely.

Use soft transitions and easing (easeInOutQuad or similar).

Auth Page (auth.html):

A minimal centered login box.

Input: type=password with placeholder “Your word”.

Button: “Login”.

When clicked, if the word matches "clawn", save a flag in localStorage and redirect to timeline.html.

If wrong, display: “Wrong word. Try again.”

Timeline Page (timeline.html):

Title: “Event Timeline”.

Five vertical “event” cards with emoji icons and short text (e.g., 🎬 Project Kickoff, 🎨 Visual Build, 🚀 Launch Day).

Each card fades in smoothly as it scrolls into view.

Background stays dark and minimalist.

Global Style (style.css):

Font: ‘Poppins’, sans-serif.

Dark background (#1b1b1b) with light text.

Use accent gradients like orange (#f46b45) or blue (#0077b6) for highlights.

Buttons rounded and hover with soft color shift.

Timeline cards have left borders in accent color and subtle glow.

Files to Include:

index.html

auth.html

timeline.html

style.css

app.js (anime.js landing animations)

auth.js (login logic)

timeline.js (scroll fade-in)

Extra polish (optional but nice):

Add a small top banner with the Clawn Media Studio name and subtle fade-in animation.

Make the layout responsive and centered.

All animations and logic should work without any build tools (just vanilla JS and anime.js).

Output the full working project folder with all code.
